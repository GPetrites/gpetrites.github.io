# Greg Petrites

Give me a business problem and Visual Studio or VS Code and I can develop the heck out of a supportable solution.  But ask me to build an informative attractive website and this is what you get.

By day, I'm a Chief Architect as a financial services firm.

At night and weekends, my interests are:
- Good food
- Good beer (life's too short for macrobrews)
- Travel to places I've not been before

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.green/@GPetrites">Mastodon</a> following environmental and urbanity.

I also have a <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@gpetrites">political face</a> on Mastodon, but my views are mine and do not reflect the firm I work for.
