# Greg Petrites

Give me a business problem and Visual Studio or VS Code and I can develop the heck out of a supportable solution.

Ask me to build an informative, attractive website and this is what you get.

By day, I'm a Chief Architect as a financial services firm.

At night and weekends, my interests are:
- Good food
- Good beer (life's too short for macrobrews)
- Travel to places I've not been before

I do like to keep things a bit separate, so I have multiple Mastodon account.

For environmental concerns and urbanism, you can find me at:
<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.green/@GPetrites">@gpetrites@mastodon.green</a>

For software and technology, I've set up shop at:
<a rel="me" href="https://techhub.social/@GPetrites">@gpetrites@techhub.social</a>

And currently, I follow politics (and everything else) at:
<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@gpetrites">@gpetrites@techhub.social</a>
but please note that my views are mine and do not reflect the firm I work for.
